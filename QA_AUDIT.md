# CHamorU QA Audit

## 2026-10-26 UTC | Android phoneme playback stall recovery

- Source reviewed: main commit 60e66126a3, `index.html` v3.9 audio diagnostics.
- Fixed: `u0PlayRecordedPhoneme` now has a 7-second watchdog and explicit stalled/failed-start/error feedback. This prevents an unresolved `Audio.play()` from trapping the guided sound sequence indefinitely in some Android in-app browsers.
- Code commit: `e291203edca12a7a8a1707a90521a7a55ba0624f`.
- Verification: JavaScript parsed successfully using `new Function`; isolated fake-Audio never-resolving-playback test confirmed timeout resolution, timer cleanup and visible stalled status. GitHub Actions run 40260815140 passed.
- NOT VERIFIED: sound heard on a physical Android phone, real device playback timing, CHamoru pronunciation, fluent-speaker approval, or a real mobile-browser end-to-end journey. English/recorded phonemes remain approximations, not authoritative language models.
- Data/UX: no storage keys, mastery gates, navigation, rewards or curriculum content changed.
- Next: real Android speaker check using Test Sound/CH/A; add robust timeout/error handling for the separate speech-synthesis sequence, then obtain fluent-speaker audio review.
